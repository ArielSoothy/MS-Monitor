## Project Overview
This is a React-based Threat Intelligence Pipeline Monitoring Dashboard for Microsoft MSTIC.
This project is for  a second interview at microsoft israel for microsoft senior data engineer mstic rnd role with the data manager and with a site reliablity manager /devops (2 people)


"this is the description of the interview btw maybe its relevant:
Areas to be assessed during the interview include Data Troubleshooting and Optimization, Programming and Scripting, Data Infrastructure and Pipelines, Behavioral and Soft Skills as well as Adaptability and Learning."

(dont write MD/readme files  and things like that. everyting should be clear on the website itself.)

I want to showcase my undersatnding and show that i implemented here solutions from questions of the first interview.

I'm expecting them to ask tough quesitons and I want them to see that I'm capabale of delivering much more than what they ask. if they ask me how to write a python function that parse parquet json and shows it and removes null, or some leet questions, I would not know from memory. but here I can show them look I can do much better than that.

So again the data team manager & site relaiablity manager/devops, 2 people interivew me on the 2nd tech round. 

So why they both interviewing me? what are the expected questions?

If this guy is DevOps and site reliablity manager he might ask related questions? optimization? etc?

They might prepare a leet questions and see how do i handle it (this is worst case as i did not do CS or had any reason to learn it). 

So i need to prepare to what I can prepare.
This project will show my ability to build a complex, scalable, and maintainable data monitoring solution using modern web technologies. It will also demonstrate my understanding of data infrastructure patterns, DevOps practices, and the Microsoft ecosystem.



 The project uses:

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript and Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for single-page application navigation
- **Styling**: CSS modules with a dark theme similar to Azure portal
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Design**: Modern, responsive design with Microsoft-style navigation

## Key Components
- **Navigation**: Clean navigation bar with Microsoft-style design
- **Pages**: Overview, Pipelines, DataLineage, Alerts
- **Mock Data**: 160 pipelines with realistic names grouped by source (LinkedIn, Twitter, Office365, AzureAD, GitHub, etc.)
- **Pipeline Status**: healthy, warning, failed, processing
- **Metrics**: lastRun, avgProcessingTime, recordsProcessed, failureRate

## Coding Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React hooks patterns
- Use CSS modules for styling
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow accessibility best practices
