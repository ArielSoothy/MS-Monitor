- *"Known issues database prevents duplicate investigation efforts"*

### **Programming & Scripting**
- *"Built with TypeScript for type safety, uses React with modern hooks patterns"*
- *"Modular CSS architecture with responsive design principles"*
- *"Integration points designed for Azure APIs and Microsoft Graph"*

### **Data Infrastructure & Pipelines**
- *"Each pipeline has defined SLA requirements and automated health monitoring"*
- *"Real-time alerting with intelligent threshold-based rules"*
- *"Scalable architecture supporting Microsoft's global operations"*

### **Behavioral & Soft Skills**
- *"Clear escalation paths ensure the right teams are contacted immediately"*
- *"Runbook integration enables consistent operational procedures"*
- *"Impact assessment helps prioritize incidents based on business criticality"*

### **Adaptability & Learning**
- *"Designed with extensibility in mind for new data sources and threat intelligence feeds"*
- *"Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes and user preferences"*
- *"Modular architecture allows for easy integration of new Azure services"*

## ‚ùì Potential Interview Questions & Prepared Answers

### Q: "How would you troubleshoot a pipeline processing slowly?"
**Answer**: "I'd start by clicking on the alert to see the enhanced details. The log references section provides direct links to Azure Monitor with correlation IDs. I'd check the pre-built diagnostic queries for CPU/memory metrics, review the known issues section for similar patterns, and follow the troubleshooting runbooks. The alert context shows threshold vs. actual values to quantify the performance degradation."

### Q: "How do you ensure this scales for Microsoft's global operations?"
**Answer**: "The architecture leverages Azure's global infrastructure. Each alert includes regional team assignments with appropriate escalation paths. The system uses correlation IDs for distributed tracing across regions. Data classification helps ensure compliance with regional data residency requirements. The responsive design works across different time zones and devices."

### Q: "What happens when a critical alert fires?"
**Answer**: "The system immediately identifies the responsible team through the point of contact section. Critical alerts trigger email and Slack notifications. Engineers get direct access to relevant logs and diagnostic queries. The impact assessment shows business criticality and affected systems. Escalation follows a defined path from team lead to engineering management to executive level."

### Q: "How do you handle data quality issues?"
**Answer**: "The impact assessment section includes data classification levels and affected systems. Known issues database captures common data quality patterns. Diagnostic queries help identify anomalies in data volume and processing patterns. The troubleshooting section links to specific runbooks for data validation procedures."
