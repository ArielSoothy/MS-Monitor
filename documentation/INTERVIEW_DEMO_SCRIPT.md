#### 4. **Geographic Threat Distribution** (1.5 minutes)
**Demonstrate:**
- Live threat intelligence by country/city
- Risk scoring algorithms
- Event volume metrics
- User correlation data

**Technical Architecture:**
- Data sourced from SecurityEvents table
- Geographic IP mapping
- Risk assessment algorithms
- Real-time aggregation

#### 5. **Real-time Threat Correlations** (1.5 minutes)
**Show the correlation table with:**
- Timestamp precision
- User identification
- Source IP tracking
- Threat classification
- Risk scoring (Critical/High/Medium)
- Pipeline attribution

**Advanced Data Concepts:**
- Event correlation across multiple data sources
- Real-time threat scoring
- User behavior analytics
- Pipeline health correlation
