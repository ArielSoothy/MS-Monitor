# How the MSTIC Monitor Works - Behind the Scenes

## What It Does
This system monitors threat intelligence data pipelines for Microsoft's Security Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC). It tracks 160+ pipelines that process security data from sources like:
- Azure Active Directory sign-in logs
- Office 365 security events  
- Microsoft Defender endpoint telemetry
- External threat intelligence feeds
- GitHub security alerts
- LinkedIn threat monitoring
- Twitter API monitoring

## How It Works

### 1. Data Simulation (Realistic Production Model)
```typescript
// Generates realistic pipeline data
const PIPELINE_SOURCES = [
  'LinkedIn Threat Feed', 'Twitter API Monitor', 'Office365 Security Events',
  'AzureAD Sign-in Analytics', 'GitHub Security Alerts', 'Defender ATP'
];
```

**In Real Microsoft Environment:**
- These would be actual connectors to Azure Sentinel, Microsoft Graph Security API
- Real-time data streams from Microsoft 365 Defender
- External threat intelligence providers (Mandiant, CrowdStrike, etc.)

### 2. Machine Learning Prediction Engine

#### Decision Tree Algorithm
The system uses a custom decision tree to predict pipeline failures based on:

**Features Used:**
- `avgProcessingTime`: How long pipelines take to run
- `failureRate`: Historical failure percentage  
- `recordsProcessed`: Data volume throughput
- `hourOfDay`: Time-based failure patterns
- `dayOfWeek`: Weekend vs weekday patterns
- `isBusinessHours`: Business impact timing

**Training Process:**
1. Generates 1,000+ historical pipeline execution records
2. Adds realistic seasonal patterns (more failures during peak hours)
3. Trains decision tree with max depth 4, min samples 10
4. Produces predictions with confidence scores

**Risk Scoring:**
```typescript
const riskScore = prediction.willFail 
  ? 50 + (prediction.confidence * 50)  // High risk: 50-100%
  : 50 - (prediction.confidence * 50); // Low risk: 0-50%
```

### 3. Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

#### Pipeline Status Tracking
- **Healthy**: Green, processing normally
- **Warning**: Yellow, performance degraded but functional  
- **Failed**: Red, critical errors requiring intervention
- **Processing**: Blue, currently running

#### Key Metrics Monitored
- **Processing Time**: Average execution duration
- **Throughput**: Records processed per hour
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed executions
- **Data Quality**: Schema validation, missing fields
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, I/O utilization

### 4. Data Lineage & Impact Analysis

The system tracks dependencies between pipelines:
```
Raw Threat Data → Normalization → Enrichment → 
Correlation → Threat Scoring → Intelligence Products
```

**Critical for:**
- Understanding cascade failures
- Impact assessment during outages
- Capacity planning
- Troubleshooting data quality issues

### 5. Alerting & Incident Response

**Proactive Alerting:**
- Predictive model flags pipelines likely to fail
- Threshold-based alerts for performance degradation
- Anomaly detection for unusual data patterns

**Incident Classification:**
- **P0**: Critical threat intelligence feed down
- **P1**: Multiple pipeline failures affecting operations
- **P2**: Single pipeline degraded performance
- **P3**: Minor issues, low business impact

## Microsoft Production Implementation

### Architecture in Real MSTIC Environment

**Data Ingestion Layer:**
- Azure Event Hubs for high-volume threat feeds
- Azure Data Factory for scheduled batch processing
- Azure Stream Analytics for real-time processing

**Storage & Processing:**
- Azure Data Lake Gen2 for raw threat intelligence
- Azure SQL Database for processed, queryable data
- Azure Synapse for large-scale analytics
- Cosmos DB for real-time pipeline status

**Machine Learning:**
- Azure Machine Learning for model training/serving
- MLflow for model versioning and experiments
- Azure AutoML for automated feature engineering
- Real-time scoring endpoints for predictions

**Monitoring & Operations:**
- Application Insights for application telemetry
- Azure Monitor for infrastructure metrics
- Log Analytics for centralized logging
- Custom dashboards (like this one) for operations teams

### Data Flow Example

1. **Threat Intelligence Ingestion**
   ```
   External Feed API → Azure Event Hub → Stream Analytics → Data Lake
   ```

2. **Real-time Processing**
   ```
   Raw Data → Normalization → Threat Scoring → 
   Correlation Engine → Threat Intelligence Products
   ```

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   ```
   Pipeline Metrics → ML Prediction Model → 
   Risk Assessment → Automated Alerts → Operations Team
   ```
