# Azure Database Check - MSTIC Interview Setup

## 🔍 Let's Identify Your Azure Database Type

You mentioned you're on "Azure Data Explorer Cluster" - this is actually **Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)**, which is different from Azure SQL Database. Let me explain:

### **Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) - What You Likely Have:**
- **Type**: Analytics database optimized for time-series and log data
- **Query Language**: KQL (Kusto Query Language) instead of SQL
- **Perfect For**: Pipeline monitoring, telemetry data, time-series metrics
- **MSTIC Context**: This is EXACTLY what Microsoft MSTIC uses for threat intelligence!

### **Azure SQL Database - Traditional SQL:**
- **Type**: Relational database with SQL queries
- **Query Language**: T-SQL (standard SQL)
- **Perfect For**: Structured data, transactions, traditional apps

## 🎯 **PLOT TWIST: Azure Data Explorer is EVEN BETTER for MSTIC!**

If you have Azure Data Explorer, this is actually **MORE impressive** for the MSTIC interview because:

1. **Real MSTIC Technology**: MSTIC actually uses Kusto/ADX for threat intelligence
2. **Shows Advanced Skills**: KQL is more specialized than SQL
3. **Time-Series Perfect**: Ideal for pipeline monitoring and metrics
4. **Microsoft-Native**: Core part of Azure Monitor, Sentinel, etc.

## 📋 **Quick Check - Please Verify:**

### **In Azure Portal, check these details:**

1. **Service Type**: 
   - Is it "Azure Data Explorer" or "SQL Database"?
   - Does it mention "Kusto" anywhere?

2. **Connection String**:
   - Does it start with `https://` and end with `.kusto.windows.net`?
   - Or does it look like a SQL connection string?

3. **Query Interface**:
   - Can you run KQL queries like `MyTable | take 10`?
   - Or SQL queries like `SELECT TOP 10 * FROM MyTable`?

## 🚀 **If It's Azure Data Explorer (Kusto):**

This is **PERFECT** for MSTIC! Here's what we'll build:

### **KQL Tables for Pipeline Monitoring:**
```kql
// Create tables for pipeline data
.create table Pipelines (
    PipelineId: string,
    PipelineName: string,
    Source: string,
    Status: string,
    LastRun: datetime,
    AvgProcessingTime: int,
    RecordsProcessed: long,
    FailureRate: real,
    OwnerTeam: string,
    Region: string,
    Timestamp: datetime
)

.create table PipelineMetrics (
    PipelineId: string,
    Timestamp: datetime,
    RecordsPerSecond: real,
    ErrorRate: real,
    CpuUsage: real,
    MemoryUsage: real
)

.create table Alerts (
    AlertId: string,
    PipelineId: string,
    AlertType: string,
    Severity: string,
    Message: string,
    CreatedAt: datetime,
    AcknowledgedAt: datetime,
    AcknowledgedBy: string
)
```

### **Sample KQL Queries for Demo:**
```kql
// Show pipeline health overview
Pipelines 
| summarize HealthyCount = countif(Status == "healthy"),
           WarningCount = countif(Status == "warning"), 
           FailedCount = countif(Status == "failed")

// Find pipelines with high failure rates
Pipelines 
| where FailureRate > 5.0
| project PipelineName, Source, FailureRate, LastRun
| order by FailureRate desc

// Time-series analysis of pipeline metrics
PipelineMetrics
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize avg(RecordsPerSecond), avg(ErrorRate) by bin(Timestamp, 1h), PipelineId
| render timechart
```

## 💡 **Interview Impact with Azure Data Explorer:**

### **For Data Manager:**
- "I'm using Azure Data Explorer, the same technology MSTIC uses for threat intelligence"
- "KQL allows for powerful time-series analysis of pipeline performance"
- "The ingestion patterns mirror real threat intelligence workflows"

### **For SRE Manager:**
- "Data Explorer provides sub-second query performance at scale"
- "Built-in time-series optimizations for monitoring data"
- "Native integration with Azure Monitor and alerting"

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

**Please check and confirm:**
1. Service name in Azure Portal
2. Connection string format
3. Whether you can run KQL or SQL queries

Then I'll help you set up the perfect integration for your MSTIC interview!

**If it's Kusto/ADX**: We'll build an amazing KQL-based pipeline monitoring system
**If it's SQL Database**: We'll use the SQL approach from the original plan

Both will be impressive, but Kusto would be PERFECT for MSTIC! 🎯
