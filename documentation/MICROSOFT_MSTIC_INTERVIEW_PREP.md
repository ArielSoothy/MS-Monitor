## ðŸ”§ Technical Deep Dive Questions You Should Be Ready For

### Data Troubleshooting & Optimization

**Q: "How would you troubleshoot a pipeline that's suddenly processing 10x slower?"**
**Your Answer:**
1. "First, I'd check the pipeline metrics dashboard - look at processing time trends, record volume, error rates"
2. "Examine resource utilization - CPU, memory, I/O bottlenecks"
3. "Check data quality - schema changes, malformed records causing parsing issues"
4. "Review dependencies - upstream data source delays, downstream consumer backpressure"
5. "In this system, the predictive model would flag this as high-risk before it fails"

**Q: "A critical threat intelligence feed is failing. Walk me through your incident response."**
**Your Answer:**
1. "Immediate: Check if it's impacting other dependent pipelines using the data lineage view"
2. "Assess business impact: Is this feed critical for active threat hunting operations?"
3. "Review error details: Connection timeouts, authentication issues, schema changes"
4. "Implement temporary workaround: Failover to backup feeds or historical data"
5. "Root cause analysis: Coordinate with external vendor or internal team"
6. "Post-incident: Update monitoring thresholds, improve alerting"

### Programming & Scripting

**Q: "Explain your technology choices for this system."**
**Your Answer:**
- "TypeScript for type safety with complex threat intelligence data structures"
- "React for responsive UI that scales to thousands of pipelines"
- "Decision tree ML model for interpretable predictions (crucial for security operations)"
- "CSS modules for maintainable styling in large codebases"
- "Vite for fast development cycles and optimized production builds"

**Q: "How would you scale this to handle 10,000 pipelines?"**
**Your Answer:**
1. "Frontend: Virtual scrolling, pagination, intelligent filtering"
2. "Backend: Microservices architecture, event-driven updates"
3. "Database: Time-series database for metrics, indexed queries"
4. "Caching: Redis for frequently accessed pipeline status"
5. "ML: Model serving on Azure ML, batch prediction updates"

### Data Infrastructure & Pipelines

**Q: "Design the architecture for MSTIC's threat intelligence platform."**
**Your Answer:**
1. **Ingestion Layer**: "Azure Event Hubs for high-throughput threat feeds"
2. **Processing**: "Azure Stream Analytics for real-time, Azure Data Factory for batch"
3. **Storage**: "Azure Data Lake for raw data, SQL Database for processed intelligence"
4. **ML/Analytics**: "Azure ML for threat scoring, Synapse for large-scale analysis"
5. **API Layer**: "Azure API Management for threat intelligence consumption"
6. **Monitoring**: "Application Insights, custom dashboards like this one"
