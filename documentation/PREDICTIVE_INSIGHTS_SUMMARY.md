# Pipeline Health Prediction Feature - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview
Successfully implemented an AI-powered Pipeline Health Prediction feature for the Microsoft MSTIC Threat Intelligence Monitoring Dashboard using a decision tree algorithm.

## ðŸš€ Key Components Implemented

### 1. **Decision Tree Algorithm** (`/src/utils/decisionTree.ts`)
- **Simple, interpretable ML model** with max depth of 4 levels
- **Feature-based prediction** using 5 key pipeline metrics
- **Gini impurity** for optimal split selection
- **Human-readable rule extraction** for transparency
- **Feature importance calculation** to show which factors matter most

### 2. **Mock Training Data Generator** (`/src/utils/mockDataGenerator.ts`)
- **1,000 realistic historical records** with seasonal patterns
- **Monday morning failures** (common after weekend maintenance)
- **End-of-day volume spikes** causing higher failure rates
- **Weekend/off-hours patterns** with reduced monitoring
- **~80% model accuracy** (realistic, not perfect)

### 3. **Predictive Insights Page** (`/src/pages/PredictiveInsights.tsx`)
- **Real-time training simulation** with progress indicator
- **Top 5 at-risk pipelines** with risk scores and confidence levels
- **Interactive prediction details** with reasoning explanations
- **Model performance metrics** (accuracy, feature importance)
- **Decision tree visualization** showing the actual logic
- **Auto-refresh every minute** for live predictions

### 4. **Smart Features for Interviews**

#### ðŸ“Š **Prediction Features**
- `hoursSinceLastRun` - Pipeline freshness indicator
- `avgFailureRate` - Historical reliability metric  
- `dataVolumeVariance` - Capacity stress indicator
- `dayOfWeek` - Seasonal failure patterns
- `hourOfDay` - Time-based risk assessment

#### ðŸ§  **Explainable AI**
- **"Why this prediction?"** section with human-readable reasoning
- **Decision path visualization** showing exact rule traversal
- **Feature importance rankings** highlighting key factors
- **Confidence scores** for prediction reliability

#### ðŸŽ¨ **Professional UI/UX**
- **Microsoft Azure-style design** with dark theme
- **Loading states** simulating real ML training
- **Interactive risk cards** with hover effects
- **Modal dialogs** for detailed prediction analysis
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
